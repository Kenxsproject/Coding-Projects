# Coding-Projects
This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my coding projects. It features a collection of diverse projects, demonstrating my proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. Each project is referred to in this README file.

# Google-Analytics Project
This project demonstrates the extraction of real-time data from the Google Analytics API using Python. It retrieves metrics such as active users and pageviews and provides an example of how to process and use this data programmatically. The project showcases the integration of the Google Analytics API, Google Cloud Platform, and Python libraries such as google-auth and google-api-python-client. It includes code snippets that authenticate with the API, retrieve real-time data, and optionally store the data in various formats, such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel files.

# Stripe Project
This Python project demonstrates how to extract data from the Stripe API and export it to an Excel spreadsheet. It utilizes the Stripe API to retrieve customer information, charges, and subscriptions. The extracted data is then stored in a list and saved to a CSV file using the csv module.
